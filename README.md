# Brain-Tumer-Detection-CNN
The code implements a CNN in PyTorch for brain tumor classification from MRI images. It customizes data handling, applies transformations, and trains the model using cross-entropy loss with an Adam optimizer. Performance is assessed with accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.
